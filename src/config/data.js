    tradeDescription: "I took two early trades, where I was a little lucky. Both of these trades could have been losers because I entered early. I had a break over lunch and then started trading again. I totaled 5 trades with 2 winners and 3 losers. I did a couple of mistakes today and ended up in negative numbers. My account is still positive. I stopped trading after my third loss, I didn't want to chase a winner and risk more money, better for me to start fresh tomorrow again.",

    summary: "Started of good but the two winning trades were a bit lucky since I took them in the middle of a trading range. I missed three opportunities that would have given me a nice profit. Another learning day, that cost med some money, I'm still positive in my account. Tha market picked up pace around 13:00 so I believe it is better for me to step aside and not trade until I have gained more experience. My total Net P&L is -$172.25 including commissions -$59.70.",

I changed to a 500 tick and a 250 tick chart because the market is so slow, 2000 tick charts are very hard to trade in this type of market. The 250 tick chart gives a very nice picture of the current context and it also displays good entry levels. I really like the slower London session ES market the US session moves so quickly even with 2000 ticks and it is harder for me to find (and believe) good entry setups.",

Every bear leg down needed more bull bars to reach the start of the bear leg in the range, this indicates more selling pressure and that the probability for the bulls to fail at resistance are high.",

    tradeDescription: "First day of my Apex Funded Trader evaluation account. Profit goal is to reach $3000 within a minimum of 7 trading days. My goal is to focus on discipline and taking every trade with context behind the entry and active trade management. I ended up with 0 pips and a commission loss of $-56.64, overall an ok first day and the session gave me some good lessons and pointers on how to trade.",

    summary: "First day with my Apex account resulted in 0 pips and a loss in commissions by -$56.64. I missed a couple of trades and made some mistakes, overall it was an ok session and it is always a little scary to start trading a 'real' account and money. I stopped trading at 13:00 because I had three losses in a row and it is better to start fresh tomorrow again. I pushed up my trailing threshold of my account from $47500 to $ 47703.76. Overall an ok first day! ",

    significantLesson: "I must not look at the PnL, instead I must see every trade as an individual trade and reset my mind after each trade. If I win then the next starts from 0 again and if I lose the next on starts from 0 after I have checked the total PnL including commissions.",

My trade management was to trail the stop if the bears couldn't break below 1.08360, the bears broke below and my target was reached. This trade should work out quickly which it did, if price would have showed resistance to break below 1.08360 I would have to tighten my stop to BE+1, if the market stopped me out it would be better to take the BE trade and wait for the next opportunity!",

    trade4: "I took this trade because of the failure to close above the trading range resistance, I saw this as a vacuum up to resistance, but I was wrong. It is dangerous to enter on the first weak breakout and the pullback was also weak by the bulls. The context was not for a short trade here, the market will probably test the resistance above at 1.08685 before turning down. ",

The bears were not able to push price below the 8:29 pre-market low (1.09280). The bulls defended this low on every test and there was a trading range between 1.09280 and 1.09385. It was a little tricky to trade when the market grinds down like it did today! It looks really easy in hindsight but it is hard for me to find good entry levels!",

    summary: "I didn't find any entry opportunities on the first bull run up (from 10:15), after the high of the session the bears just grinded the market down. I had difficulty of finding good entries and hesitated a lot. There were a couple of good short entries that I was thinking of trading but I hesitated and missed these opportunities (marked with a circle). My last trade of this session was how I should have traded today! When we get a test of the high and then no resumption of the bull leg up, I should remember this kind of scenario when the bears grinds price down slowly. When I look at the chart in hindsight there NO higher highs or higher lows! Almost ALL bars are below the EMA!",

    significantLesson: "The lesson to be learned from todays session is to remember that when we get a grinding market that just moves lower, with lower highs and lows, I need to enter with limit orders at the test of EMA and also look for entries to short at the resistance levels in the micro trading ranges when the market is grinding down like it did today!",

The pre-trade context was AIL (Always in long) there was acceptance above all the previous swing highs on the way up in the bull rally, the bull rally had three swings up with strong buying pressure, so the pre-trade context was for a pullback and more up. The pullback was however strong with strong bear bars closing on their lows. The strong pullback indicates that the bears are strong, the bulls took profit in the pullback which gives us selling by both the bulls and bears!
