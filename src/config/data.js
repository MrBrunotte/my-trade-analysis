    tradeDescription: "Traded the London morning session from 9:45. The session started with a bear trend continuation after a sideways market after the first bear leg down after test of daily high (during the Asian session). I was a bit eager to get my first trade going, which is not a great mental state, so I started the session with a loss, overall I had a good feeling for the price action, I just need more confidence to enter, this will come with experience!",

    summary: "Ok session that started of with a loss, I missed to great entries that I was thinking of taking (see the circles). My feel for the session was good and I read price ok. The third entry was a mistake and a hope trade, I didn't trust what I saw, instead I pushed my decision towards what I wanted to happen!",

    significantLesson: "Missed a high probability trade at 10:44, I was waiting for several retests of the resistance level and I also hesitated because I had a loss. I must trust my read, the bull leg up to resistance showed selling pressure from the bears with overlapping bars and tails on top, even though the majority of bars where green bull bars.",

    trade1Header:"Trade 1, Short, stopped out -7 pips",
    reasonToTakeTrade1: "Second retest of EMA after failed breakout above, strong bear leg down and acceptance below earlier swing lows.",
    trade1: "I was early and got stopped out with one pip. I also entered after the market gave me a high closing bull bar and a medium strong bear bar closing near the bull bar close. I should have waited before I entered for mor information and a retest of the previous swing high. If I had not been stopped out this would still have been a bad trade, need to be a little more patient before entering to sell in the bull flag in a bear trend.",

    reasonToTakeTrade2: "",
    trade2: "Entered short at the double top sell signal, the bulls retested the old support from below but was not able to close above. I entered with a limit order, I should have entered a little bit higher but overall the entry was ok and moved to target rather easy. Good trade with ok entry, I entered based on context.",

    trade3Header:"Trade 3, Short, stopped out -5 pips",
    reasonToTakeTrade3: "Third attempt by the bulls to go higher.",
    trade3: "Entered and got some slippage, I had the entry one pip below the bar but still got filled @ 1.09115. The bulls were a bit to strong on the way up from the swing low and I was thinking of this and therefore had my entry 1 pip below the open of the bar, I should have waited for more information and I should have been more disciplined. This was more of a hope trade than based on context!",

    tradeDescription: "Todays session started with bears taking control of the market around 9:30, it looked like they wanted to push down the market to yesterdays low (at 1.08835). I took two trades with good context behind the entries. I missed a perfect MTR (Major Trend Reversal, see the circle). I was focused on getting in with a limit order at the low of the micro trading range and micro double bottom, I missed the stop order entry above the nice high close bull bar. I the market gives me a high close bar (100%) I should take the stop order entry, an entry like that should work out quickly so I could have a smaller stop. The context was perfect for a reversal by the bulls at 11:15.",

    summary: "Nice short session that gave me three trade opportunities, I managed to take 2 out of 3 which is good. I had great R:R on my trades, 2:8 on both trades.",

    significantLesson: "I must trust a setup like the MTR (Major Trend Reversal) and I should not look for it to be perfect, like it was in this session. I also need to trust the high close (100%) bars when then fit with context, these entries should be quick and easy, so I should be able to get my scalp with lesser risk. I always need to focus on the context from both sides (bulls and bears). I should try to see it from both sides before placing a trade.",

    tradeDescription: "I traded the London morning session, from 10:00 (3 contracts per trade). Before my session there were lots of sideways action after a pre-session sell off around 08:00. The bears were not able to push price below the 8:29 pre-market low (1.09280). The bulls defended this low on every test and there was a trading range between 1.09280 and 1.09385. It was a little tricky to trade when the market grinds down like it did today! It looks really easy in hindsight but it is hard for me to find good entry levels!",

    summary: "I didn't find any entry opportunities on the first bull run up (from 10:15), after the high of the session the bears just grinded the market down. I had difficulty of finding good entries and hesitated a lot. There were a couple of good short entries that I was thinking of trading but I hesitated and missed these opportunities (marked with a circle). My last trade of this session was how I should have traded today! When we get a test of the high and then no resumption of the bull leg up, I should remember this kind of scenario when the bears grinds price down slowly. When I look at the chart in hindsight there NO higher highs or higher lows! Almost ALL bars are below the EMA!",

    significantLesson: "The lesson to be learned from todays session is to remember that when we get a grinding market that just moves lower, with lower highs and lows, I need to enter with limit orders at the test of EMA and also look for entries to short at the resistance levels in the micro trading ranges when the market is grinding down like it did today!",

    trade1Header:"Trade 1, long, Stop -4 pips",
    reasonToTakeTrade1: "Pullback to EMA after strong bull rally to open high and acceptance above.",
    trade1: "I took the trade early, there was no good signal bar and it was a bad entry to take, it was more of a hope entry than based on context. The pre-trade context was AIL (Always in long) there was acceptance above all the previous swing highs on the way up in the bull rally, the bull rally had three swings up with strong buying pressure, so the pre-trade context was for a pullback and more up. The pullback was however strong with strong bear bars closing on their lows. The strong pullback indicates that the bears are strong, the bulls took profit in the pullback which gives us selling by both the bulls and bears! I took the trade based on a re-test of the bull rally high with a smaller risk to reward (0,5:1).",

    reasonToTakeTrade2: "Pullback after second leg down, close above EMA after strong bull rally.",
    trade2: "Entered after the close of the high close bull bar above the EMA after a two-legged pullback. The context for more up was good and I should have moved my stop closer more aggressive, this trade should have worked out right away, and if that would not happen I should have tightened my stop to one tick below my entry bar. OK entry reason, not so good risk management in this trade.",

The bulls was not able to push the market up and failed on every attempt, so a test of support lower had a high probability to work.

    reasonToTakeTrade4: "Hope entry! I was to focused on a break out lower, not a good entry!",
    trade4: "I entered short late in the bull high close bar. I must wait for the bar to close before placing my trade! If I had done this here i would not have entered into the buying pressure. Not a good trade even though the market probably will fall down a little more, should have waited for the test of the EMA since the last test were many bars prior.

I think it is best to only focus on one instrument now in the beginning! The market made a strong bull move at the start of the US session so my bias was up from the start of this session. The session moved up but in a slow grinding fashion which makes it a little bit hard to trade now that I just have started.",

    tradeDescription: "First 6E (forex futures) session. I traded the early London session before lunch, I got two trades that hit target. I used my three contract scalping strategy and my target for each trade was $150. The early London session was quite slow which was good for me, I was able to think over my entries and did not have to rush into them. I missed an opportunity at the end of my session.",
    summary: "Morning London session, I trade the 6E market (forex futures). The market was in a bear trend after making the high of the day earlier. I took two trades that each made target without any problem. The market was quite slow and this makes it easier to analyze the market better. I’m happy with my trades and I had good reasons for the entries. 2 winners, 0 losers, and 0 break-even trades, good session! I missed a trade opportunity around 11:24, but I hesitated because 7 out of 8 bars were bull bars. I was thinking of entering short for a test of the EMA, hesitated and missed the opportunity.",

My stop loss was one pip above the tails so I had a R:R of 1:2 on this trade. The scalp too 2:57 minutes and was not even close to my stop. I set my target to close the EMA gap in a pullback in a bear trend, price was vacuumed down to EMA.",

The R:R was 5:8 so almost a 1:2 risk/reward. My target was one pip above the open of the bull climax bar.",

    tradeDescription: "This is the first session where I have traded with my new 1-tick scalping method. The basic setup is that I enter the market after and on the close of a trigger bar. I always need a signal bar that closes within the 75% upper range in an uptrend or closes within the lower 25% of the signal bar range. I may only enter if the signal bar is a 100% high-, or low-closing bar, if this happens I may enter early and take a chance.",
    
    summary: "The lesson to be learned from this session is that I can take a chance and enter at the close of a strong signal bar closing on its high or low (100%)! The bulls/bears are clearly in control and there is a high probability of at least 1 point up/down on the trigger bar. This is the only time I may enter with a signal bar!
